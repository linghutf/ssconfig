# ssconfig
- This is an util pacakge for scrap useful ss config node.
- It's a expriment for me to learn `goquery` and `json`,and so simple.
- I will be happy if it can help you sometimes.

# Usage:
1. Download the package and just write `main.go` like:
```
package main
import "<the package path>/ss"

func main(){
ss.ScrapUsefulNode()
}
```

2. Then`you will get three `config.json`,run it:
```
sslocal -c config[0/1/2].json
```

## What you can get from this repository:
1. parse html by using `goquery`
2. json marshal and un marshal to files.
